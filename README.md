In this project I will use MySQL

First of all I will import the CSV files to work, the CSV are the next:
 - departments
 - dept_emp
 - dept_manager
 - employees
 - salaries
 - titles
 
Fix the info of some of the columns like in employees table, change the dates MM-DD-YYYY to YYYY-MM-DD

Next is neccesary to apply Primary keys for each table when is neccesary (column is unique)

After this we can continue with the task of data analysis creating different queries for this purpose, the queries are in my sql script in this same repository
